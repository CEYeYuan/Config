#####You can use the git remote set-url command to match a remote URL with a name
git remote set-url name  <REMOTE_URL> 

######  Add a remote 
To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.

The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git

git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

###### Renaming a Remote 

The git remote rename command takes two arguments:

An existing remote name, for example, origin
A new name for the remote, for example, destination

git remote rename origin destination

##### See the details about the remote 
git remote -v

##### Remove a remote 

The git remote rm command takes one argument:

A remote name, for example, destination


#### Interact with remote 

When working with other people's repositories, there are a few basic Git commands 
to remember:

git clone
git fetch
git merge
git pull
These commands are very useful when interacting with a remote repository. clone and 
fetch download remote code from a repository's remote URL to your local computer, 
merge is used to merge different people's work together with yours, and pull is a 
combination of fetch and merge.

git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
# Clones a repository to your computer

When you run git clone, the following actions occur:

A new folder called repo is made
It is initialized as a Git repository
A remote named origin is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from
All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there
The default branch (usually called master) is checked out

Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository
grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into
 your own branches.

If you already have a local repository with a remote URL set up for the desired project,
you can grab all the new information by using git fetch *remotename* in the terminal:

git fetch remotename
# Fetches updates made to a remote repository

git fetch remotename
# Fetches updates made to a remote repository
Otherwise, you can always add a new remote and then fetch.

Merging combines your local changes with changes made by others.

Typically, you'd merge a remote-tracking branch (i.e., a branch fetched from a remote 
repository) with your local branch:

git merge remotename/branchname
# Merges updates made online with your local work

git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git merge in the 
same command:

git pull remotename branchname
# Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work
Because pull performs a merge on the retrieved changes, you should ensure that your local
work is committed before running the pull command. If you run into a merge conflict
you cannot resolve, or if you decide to quit the merge, you can use git merge --abort 
to take the branch back to where it was in before you pulled.


##### how to push to a remote 
Use git push to push your local branch to a remote repository.

The git push command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A branch name, for example, master
git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> 
As an example, you usually run git push origin master to push your local changes to your
online repository.

To rename a branch, you'd use the same git push command, but you would add one more argument:
the name of the new branch. For example:

git push  <REMOTENAME> <LOCALBRANCHNAME>:<REMOTEBRANCHNAME> 
This pushes the LOCALBRANCHNAME to your REMOTENAME, but it is renamed to REMOTEBRANCHNAME.


Pushing tags

By default, and without additional parameters, git push sends all matching branches that have the 
same names as remote branches.

To push a single tag, you can issue the same command as pushing a branch:

git push  <REMOTENAME> <TAGNAME> 
To push all your tags, you can type the command:

git push  <REMOTENAME> --tags

Deleting a remote branch or tag

The syntax to delete a branch is a bit arcane at first glance:

git push  <REMOTENAME> :<BRANCHNAME> 
Note that there is a space before the colon. The command resembles the same steps you'd take
to rename a branch. However, here, you're telling Git to push nothing into BRANCHNAME on REMOTENAME.
Because of this, git push deletes the branch on the remote repository.

Remotes and forks

You might already know that you can "fork" repositories on GitHub.

When you clone a repository you own, you provide it with a remote URL that tells Git 
where to fetch and push updates. If you want to collaborate with the original repository, 
you'd add a new remote URL, typically called upstream, to your local Git clone:

git remote set-url upstream  <THEIR_REMOTE_URL> 
Now, you can fetch updates and branches from their fork:

git fetch upstream branch
# Grab the upstream remote's branches
# remote: Counting objects: 75, done.
# remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done.
# remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9)
# Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done.
# From https://github.com/octocat/repo
#  * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
When you're done making local changes, you can push your local branch to GitHub and initiate 
a pull request.
