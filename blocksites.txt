modify: /etc/hosts 
if you want to block www.renren.com, you can just add one lien:
	127.0.0.1 www.renren.com
Why it works?
When client want to visit a particular website, the first thing is to send a request to the DNS, and DNS will parse 
the domain into a ip address. However, /etc/hosts takes precedence over the DNS, if the domain can be found it here,
there is no need to request the DNS. The domain will be parsed into localhost, which definetely is not correct, so 
we can block that site.
